# Python PDF to PNG
Converting a PDF to a PNG using wand, --pythonMagic-- and --PythonMagicWand-- as a comparison

I found that wand seems to be the only currently supported imagemagick library for python.

It was also found that jpeg results in better image output that PNG files. This could be dependant on the PDF, but it's worth a try if your output needs improvement.
